Introduction

For our project, we chose to focus on the reforestation of countries worldwide.
We identified datasets providing this information in percentage and in hectares per year.
To be able to combine these datasets, we found a table containing  for each country its code(referenced from an ISO norm), and its coordinates.
Discussing our business model, we decided to retrieve an extra one to have data about tourism,
and decided to work as a tourism agency, looking to expand into ecotourism and therefore need to find suitable locations to start building eco-tour packages


Hypothesis

We chose two hypothesis:
We suspect countries with reforestation would be good for eco-tourists, so which countries worldwide are experiencing reforestation? 
Which of the most-visited countries are relevant for landuse in term of forests? â†’ Which of the reforested countries are among the most-visited countries?

Data preparation and Analysis

The initial datasets were prepared to allow us to fit into our database,
allowing us to retrieve informations about visits and evolution of landuse by country.
Our database contains four tables, with three tables containing the countries information and one allowing us to join them.


We then
